## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.enriched_transaction import EnrichedTransaction

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of EnrichedTransaction from a JSON string
enriched_transaction_instance = EnrichedTransaction.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(EnrichedTransaction.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
enriched_transaction_dict = enriched_transaction_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of EnrichedTransaction from a dict
enriched_transaction_from_dict = EnrichedTransaction.from_dict(enriched_transaction_dict)
