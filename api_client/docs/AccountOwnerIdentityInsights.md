## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.account_owner_identity_insights import AccountOwnerIdentityInsights

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of AccountOwnerIdentityInsights from a JSON string
account_owner_identity_insights_instance = AccountOwnerIdentityInsights.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(AccountOwnerIdentityInsights.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
account_owner_identity_insights_dict = account_owner_identity_insights_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of AccountOwnerIdentityInsights from a dict
account_owner_identity_insights_from_dict = AccountOwnerIdentityInsights.from_dict(account_owner_identity_insights_dict)
